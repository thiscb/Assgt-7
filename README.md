Rational Number Java Library
This Java library provides an implementation of rational numbers, which are fractions of two integers.

Usage
Creating a Rational Number
To create a new RationalNumber instance, use the following constructor:

java
Copy code
RationalNumber rational = new RationalNumber(numerator, denominator);
where numerator and denominator are integers representing the numerator and denominator of the fraction, respectively. If the denominator is zero, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.

Operations
The following operations are supported:

Addition: rational1.add(rational2)
Subtraction: rational1.subtract(rational2)
Multiplication: rational1.multiply(rational2)
Division: rational1.divide(rational2)
Equality check: rational1.equals(rational2)
Conversion to double: rational.toDouble()
Absolute value: rational.abs()
